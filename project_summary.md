## Detailed System Flow and Tool Integration

### Initial Prompt Processing Flow

When a user submits a natural language prompt, the system immediately creates a new test run record in Convex with "generating" status. The FastAPI backend receives the prompt and initiates an LLM call to analyze the testing scenario. The LLM processes the prompt to identify distinct website testing flows, considering factors like different user paths, edge cases, form interactions, navigation sequences, and potential failure scenarios.

The LLM generates between three to five distinct flows, each with a descriptive name, detailed natural language instructions suitable for Browser Use agents, estimated execution time, and identified success criteria. Each flow description includes specific actions like "navigate to homepage, click login button, enter credentials, verify dashboard loads" with enough detail for autonomous execution.

### Flow Generation and Validation Process

After LLM generation, the system presents flows to the user in an interactive list interface. Each flow displays with an editable text area containing the natural language instructions, a suggested name that users can modify, and estimated execution time. Users can delete unwanted flows, modify existing flow descriptions, add entirely new flows manually, or regenerate specific flows through additional LLM calls.

The system validates each flow description for completeness, checking that instructions include clear starting points, specific actions to perform, and success criteria. Invalid flows receive warning indicators with suggested improvements. Only flows marked as approved proceed to execution phase.

### Browser Use Cloud Session Initialization

Once users approve flows and click "Start Testing", the system transitions to execution mode. The backend iterates through each approved flow and initiates Browser Use Cloud session creation through their Python SDK. Each session creation call includes configuration for viewport size, user agent settings, and timeout parameters appropriate for testing scenarios.

The Browser Use Cloud service responds with session identifiers and connection details for each created session. The backend stores these session references in Convex and begins monitoring session status through cloud APIs. Failed session creation triggers immediate error handling with user notification and option to retry specific flows.

### Browser Use Agent Spawning and Configuration

For each successful Browser Use Cloud session, the backend spawns a dedicated Browser Use agent process. Each agent receives the flow's natural language instructions as its primary task, along with a system prompt optimized for testing scenarios. The system prompt emphasizes detailed logging, clear success/failure reporting, screenshot capture at key steps, and structured error reporting.

Agents connect to their assigned Browser Use Cloud sessions through SDK methods, establishing communication channels for browser control commands and real-time data streaming. Each agent operates independently with complete isolation from other concurrent agents.

### Real-time WebSocket Communication Setup

The FastAPI backend establishes WebSocket connections with the frontend immediately upon execution start. The connection handles multiplexed messaging for all concurrent browser sessions, routing messages based on session identifiers and message types. Message types include session status updates, browser console logs, agent action descriptions, screenshot notifications, and error reports.

The frontend WebSocket client automatically routes incoming messages to appropriate UI components based on session mapping. Connection resilience includes automatic reconnection on failure and message queuing during temporary disconnections.

### Parallel Browser Execution Orchestration

All Browser Use agents begin executing simultaneously across their cloud-managed sessions. Each agent processes its natural language instructions step by step, translating high-level actions into specific browser automation commands. Agents navigate websites, interact with elements, fill forms, click buttons, and verify expected outcomes according to their assigned flow descriptions.

Throughout execution, agents continuously stream progress updates through Browser Use Cloud's real-time capabilities. These updates include current action descriptions, browser console outputs, screenshot captures at key steps, and intermediate success/failure status reports.

### Live Frontend Monitoring and Visualization

The frontend displays a responsive grid layout with one cell per executing browser session. Each cell contains a live browser viewport streamed from Browser Use Cloud, real-time scrolling console log panel, current step indicator showing agent's current action, execution progress bar, and status indicator with color-coded states.

Users can click any browser cell to expand it into a detailed view with larger viewport, comprehensive log history, screenshot timeline, and execution statistics. The interface updates in real-time without manual refresh, maintaining smooth user experience throughout concurrent executions.

### Results Collection and Analysis

As each Browser Use agent completes its flow, the system captures comprehensive results through Browser Use Cloud APIs. Successful executions include completion timestamp, total execution time, final screenshot, complete action log, and success confirmation. Failed executions include failure reason, error screenshot, partial execution log, and specific step where failure occurred.

The backend aggregates results from all completed flows and updates the test run status in Convex. The frontend displays individual flow results in expanded cards showing success/failure status, execution timing, key screenshots, and detailed logs. Overall test run summary includes pass/fail statistics, total execution time, and options for result export or selective re-execution.

## Remote Browser Session Architecture

### Browser Use Cloud Integration Details

Each test flow requires an independent remote browser session managed by Browser Use Cloud service. The system creates new browser sessions through the Browser Use Cloud Python SDK using their session creation endpoints. Session creation includes configuration parameters for browser type, viewport dimensions, geographic location, and resource limits.

Browser Use Cloud handles all underlying browser infrastructure including browser instance provisioning, network configuration, security isolation, and resource management. The service provides session monitoring APIs that the backend uses to track session health, resource usage, and execution status.

### Agent-Cloud Session Binding

Browser Use agents establish connections to their assigned cloud sessions through SDK authentication and session binding methods. Each agent receives exclusive access to its cloud session, preventing conflicts between concurrent executions. The SDK provides methods for browser navigation, element interaction, screenshot capture, and console log access.

Session binding includes authentication verification, capability negotiation, and communication channel establishment. Failed bindings trigger automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff before reporting permanent failure to the user interface.

### Cloud Session Lifecycle Management

Browser Use Cloud sessions follow a defined lifecycle from creation through execution to cleanup. The backend monitors session states through cloud APIs, tracking transitions from "initializing" to "ready" to "executing" to "completed" or "failed". Session state changes trigger WebSocket notifications to keep the frontend synchronized with execution status.

Session cleanup occurs automatically upon flow completion or failure, with the backend calling Browser Use Cloud termination APIs to release resources. Orphaned sessions receive automatic cleanup through timeout mechanisms to prevent resource leaks.

### Real-time Data Streaming Architecture

Browser Use Cloud provides built-in streaming capabilities for browser viewports, console outputs, and execution events. The backend subscribes to these streams for each active session and aggregates the data for frontend distribution through WebSocket connections.

Streaming data includes browser viewport updates at configurable frame rates, console log messages with timestamps and severity levels, network request/response information, and JavaScript execution events. The backend filters and routes this data to appropriate frontend components based on session identifiers.

## User Experience Flow Architecture

### Prompt Input and Initial Interface

The landing page presents a clean interface with a large text input area for natural language prompts, placeholder text providing example prompts like "Test the checkout flow on an e-commerce site" or "Verify user registration and login functionality", and a prominent "Generate Flows" button to initiate processing.

The interface includes contextual help explaining prompt format expectations, examples of effective prompts that generate useful flows, and guidelines for describing testing scenarios clearly. Input validation provides real-time feedback on prompt length and content appropriateness.

### Flow Generation and User Review

After prompt submission, the interface transitions to a loading state with progress indicators and estimated completion time. Upon LLM completion, the system displays generated flows in an organized list format with each flow showing in an expandable card containing editable flow name, detailed instruction text area, estimated execution time, and action buttons for deletion or regeneration.

Users can modify flow descriptions directly in text areas with real-time validation feedback. The interface provides flow management tools including drag-and-drop reordering, bulk actions for multiple flows, and the ability to add custom flows manually. A flow approval checklist ensures users review each flow before execution approval.

### Execution Initialization and Transition

Upon user approval, the interface transitions to execution mode with visual feedback showing Browser Use Cloud session creation progress. Each flow displays with initialization status, estimated start time, and progress indicators. Failed initializations show retry options and error details without blocking other flows from proceeding.

The transition includes user education about the upcoming execution interface, explanation of available interaction options during execution, and clear indicators of expected execution duration based on flow complexity.

### Live Execution Monitoring Interface

The execution interface presents a responsive grid layout adapting to the number of concurrent flows with optimal cell sizing for viewport visibility and log readability. Each browser cell contains a live video stream of the browser viewport, scrolling console log panel with search and filtering capabilities, current action description with step progress, and execution timing information.

Interactive features include click-to-expand for detailed session viewing, log export functionality for individual sessions, screenshot capture on demand, and pause/resume capabilities for debugging purposes. The interface maintains smooth performance with efficient video streaming and selective data loading.

### Results Presentation and Analysis

Upon execution completion, the interface transitions to results mode displaying comprehensive test run summary with overall pass/fail statistics, total execution time across all flows, and individual flow results in organized cards. Each result card shows success/failure status with clear visual indicators, execution timing and performance metrics, final screenshots and key intermediate captures, and complete execution logs with step-by-step details.

Results include analysis features like error categorization, performance comparison across flows, screenshot timeline for visual debugging, and export options for detailed reporting. Users can initiate selective re-execution of failed flows or complete test run repetition with modified parameters.
