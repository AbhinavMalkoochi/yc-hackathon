# AI Browser Testing Agent - Simplified MVP Tasks

## Project Overview

**Simplified MVP Goal**: Users input natural language prompts → Generate website testing flows → Users accept/edit flows → Create parallel browser sessions to test flows on websites

**Core Stack**:

- Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: FastAPI (Python), WebSocket for real-time streaming
- Database: Convex (real-time database)
- Browser Automation: Browser Use Python library (parallel browser sessions)
- Real-time Communication: WebSocket connections for live streaming

**What's REMOVED for MVP**:

- Authentication/Clerk
- File upload system
- Notification systems
- Data export functionality
- Web scraping features
- Playwright (replaced with Browser Use)
- Over-engineered features

## Task Structure

Each task is designed to be:

1. **Small & Testable**: Can be completed and tested independently
2. **Frontend Testable**: Every backend function has a corresponding frontend test interface
3. **Incremental**: Builds upon previous tasks for continuous validation
4. **MVP-Focused**: Only includes essential functionality

## Continuous Testing Strategy

### Testing Approach

Each task includes a frontend testing component that immediately validates backend functionality:

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Every backend function accessible via frontend interface
2. **Visual Validation**: All backend processes have visual indicators on frontend
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Live logs and status updates for all operations
4. **Error Visibility**: All errors immediately visible with actionable feedback
5. **Performance Tracking**: Real-time performance metrics displayed

### Quality Gates

Before completing each task:

- [ ] Backend functionality works correctly
- [ ] Frontend interface provides full access to backend features
- [ ] Real-time updates work without refresh
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable
- [ ] Documentation updated

### MVP Success Criteria

- User can input natural language prompts
- System generates 3-5 relevant testing flows
- User can edit and approve flows
- System executes up to 5 parallel browser sessions
- Real-time progress visible for all sessions
- Comprehensive results displayed after execution
- System handles errors gracefully with user feedback

## Development Notes

### Browser Use Integration

Based on the project summary sample code:

```python
# Parallel browser sessions with Browser Use
agents = [
    Agent(task=task, llm=llm, browser=browser)
    for task in flows
]
await asyncio.gather(*[agent.run() for agent in agents])
```

### WebSocket Message Structure

```json
{
  "type": "session_update",
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "data": {
    "status": "running",
    "current_action": "Navigating to homepage",
    "progress": 0.3,
    "logs": ["Started session", "Navigation complete"]
  }
}
```

### Key Simplifications

- No authentication system (direct access)
- No file uploads (flows generated from text prompts only)
- No complex notifications (simple real-time status updates)
- No data export (results displayed in interface)
- No web scraping (Browser Use handles all browser interactions)
- No Playwright (Browser Use replacement)

This task structure ensures rapid MVP development with continuous testing and validation at every step.
